# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

.DS_Store

# Ignore the npm-managed 'node_modules' folder, the 'dist' folder that stores compiled files, and bundle.js to prevent git commit noise:
/dist
/node_modules
# /app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js
